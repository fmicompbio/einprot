Thread number set to 64
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Implicit protein grouping: protein names; this determines which peptides are considered 'proteotypic' and thus affects protein FDR calculation
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 1.5e-05 (MS2) and 1.5e-05 (MS1)
