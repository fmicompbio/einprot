This example data set comes from Van Puyvelde et al: A comprehensive LFQ benchmark dataset on modern day acquisition strategies in proteomics, Scientific Data 2022 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01216-6). The raw data was processed by Tobias Kockmann (FGCZ) and downloaded from http://fgcz-ms.uzh.ch/public/PXD028735/dia/out-2023-07-17/. Only six of the original samples are used, for space reasons. In addition, the included pr_matrix.tsv only contains the first 100 lines of the original pr_matrix.tsv file, and the main report is subset to contain the same precursor IDs that are retained from the pr_matrix.tsv file.
