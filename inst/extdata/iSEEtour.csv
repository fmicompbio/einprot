"#Welcome","Welcome to this iSEE application generated by the einprot package! This tour will guide you through the interface. At any time, you can leave the tour by clicking outside this window."
"#VolcanoPlot1","The volcano plots display the log-fold change vs the negative log of the p-value. Significantly up- or downregulated features (using the thresholds defined in the 'Data parameters' collapsible box) are indicated with color. Selecting points in one of the plots (by drawing a rectangle in the plot window) transmits the selection to the other panels as well. Hovering over the points displays the feature ID."
"#VolcanoPlot1_VisualBoxOpen","By clicking on the 'Visual parameters' collapsible box you can control the visual appearance of the plot."
"#MAPlot1","The MA plots display the average abundance vs the log-fold change. As for the volcano plots, selecting points in one panel highlights them also in the other panels (as well as in the volcano plots). You can always see the current transmission setup in the bottom of each panel."
"#RowDataTable1","The row data table provides information about the features in your data set. You can sort or filter by any of the columns. Clicking on a row in the table will transmit the selected feature to..."
"#FeatureAssayPlot1","...the feature assay plot, which shows the abundance of the selected feature in each of the samples. Imputed values are represented in grey, observed in red."
"#ReducedDimensionPlot1","The reduced dimension plot shows the low-dimensional representation of the samples, obtained using principal component analysis."
"#FeatureSetTable1","The feature set table lists the feature sets that have been tested for enrichment. Clicking on one of the rows will transmit the selection to the row data table, the volcano and MA plots, as well as to..."
"#ComplexHeatmapPlot1","...the heatmap, which gives an overview of the abundance of the features in the selected feature set."
"#SampleAssayPlot1","The sample assay plot can be useful e.g. for investigating the correlation between any pair of samples in your data set."
"#ColumnDataPlot1","The column data plot lets you visualize any (pair of) sample annotations in your data set. The annotations to display can be selected in the 'Data parameters' collapsible box."
"#RowDataPlot1","Similarly, the row data plot allows you to visualize any pair of feature annotations in the data set."
"#Conclusion","Thank you for taking this tour, and have fun exploring your data! For more information about iSEE, check out the Bioconductor landing page (https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/) or the publication (https://f1000research.com/articles/7-741/v1)"
