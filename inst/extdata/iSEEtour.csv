"#Welcome","Welcome to this iSEE application! iSEE is an R package that lets you generate interactive interfaces for exploring any type of rectangular data. This tour will guide you through the custom interface created by the einprot package. At any time, you can leave the tour by clicking outside this window."
".navbar-static-top","You can also restart the tour at any time by clicking on the question mark icon, and then 'Click me for a quick tour'"
".navbar-static-top","einprot has initiated the interface with a specified set of panels. If you would like, you can add, remove or rearrange panels by clicking on 'Organization' - 'Organize panels'. The iSEE documentation provides much more details about the standard panels, and extension packages such as iSEEu and iSEEhex provide additional panels."
"#VolcanoPlot1","The volcano plots display the log-fold change vs the negative log of the p-value, for a given contrast (indicated via the axis labels). Significantly up- or downregulated features (using the thresholds defined in the 'Data parameters' collapsible box) are indicated with color. Selecting points in one of the plots (by drawing a rectangle in the plot window) transmits the selection to the other panels as well. Hovering over the points displays the feature ID."
"#VolcanoPlot1_VisualBoxOpen","By clicking on the 'Visual parameters' collapsible box you can control the visual appearance of the plot."
"#MAPlot1","The MA plots display the average abundance vs the log-fold change. As for the volcano plots, selecting points in one panel highlights them also in the other panels (as well as in the volcano plots). If any points are selected, you can see the current transmission setup in the bottom of each panel."
"#RowDataTable1","The row data table provides information about the features in your data set. You can sort or filter by any of the columns. Clicking on a row in the table will transmit the selected feature to..."
"#FeatureAssayPlot1","...the feature assay plot, which shows the abundance of the selected feature in each of the samples. Imputed values are represented in grey, observed in red."
"#ReducedDimensionPlot1","The reduced dimension plot shows a low-dimensional representation of the samples, obtained using principal component analysis (PCA)."
"#FeatureSetTable1","The feature set table lists the feature sets that have been tested for enrichment. Clicking on one of the rows will transmit the selection to the row data table, the volcano and MA plots, as well as to..."
"#ComplexHeatmapPlot1","...the heatmap, which gives an overview of the abundance of the features in the selected feature set."
"#SampleAssayPlot1","The sample assay plot can be useful e.g. for investigating the correlation between any pair of samples in your data set."
"#SampleAssayPlot1_DataBoxOpen","Select the samples to plot via the 'Data parameters' collapsible box."
"#ColumnDataPlot1","The column data plot lets you visualize any (pair of) sample annotations in your data set. The annotations to display can be selected in the 'Data parameters' collapsible box."
"#RowDataPlot1","Similarly, the row data plot allows you to visualize any pair of feature annotations in the data set."
