Tim50 promotes the interaction of a presequence-carrying preprotein emerging from the Tom40 channel with the intermembrane space domain of the receptor Tom22. Tethering of Tim21 to Tom22 may allow the preprotein to be released from the TOM complex and engage with the Tim23 channel. Tim21 also promotes dissociation of the motor PAM from the TIM23 complex, a PAM-free TIM23 complex promotes inner membrane sorting of of cleavable preproteins with a hydrophobic sorting signal. Tim17 causes PAM association to the TIM23core upon Tim21 dissociation.	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O13636(0)|O94618(0)|P87130(0)|Q9USM7(0)

RFC uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to recruit PCNA to DNA, break one clamp interface, and topologically link the clamp to primed template DNA during the duplication of chromosomal DNA prior to cell division. After loading PCNA, RFC then dissociates, allowing PCNA to function with Pol-delta RFC consists of five subunits in a spiral arrangement, each subunit being AAA+ family proteins, and the complex contains four ATP sites located at subunit interfaces. A cavity exists in the center of this protein spiral that accommodates double-stranded DNA. Conserved polar and positively charged residues line the cavity and interact with DNA. There is a gap between two subunits, RFC1 and RFC5, which may provide an exit path for single-stranded DNA from the central cavity.	-	Heteropentamer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	O14003(1)|O60182(1)|O94449(1)|O94697(1)|Q09843(1)

Exists as a double back-to-back homotrimeric ring which encircles double-stranded DNA and slides spontaneously across it. Loaded onto at template-primer junctions synthesized on unwound DNA during S phase in an ATP-dependent process by replication factor C (CPX-546), where it recruits replicative DNA polymerases and stimulates their activity. The process of chromatin assembly is tightly coupled to DNA replication or repair and the double homotrimer allows DNA polymerase delta to binds to one homotrimer whilst the chromatin assembly factor-1 CNOT7 binds to the other.	MW = 100kDa (homotrimer), the double homotrimer = 200kDa. The inner cavity of the protein ring has a diameter of about 30 A. The inner surface of the ring has a positive electrostatic potential with as many as 10 positively charged amino acids per subunit protruding from alpha helices inward into the central cavity.	Homotrimer.	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	Q03392(3)
