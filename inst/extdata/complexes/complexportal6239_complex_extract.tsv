In the germline, silencing occurs on the X chromosomes in hermaphrodites thus controlling germline development. 	Stokes radius is approximately 6.93nm. Molecular mass is approximately 255kDa.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	O17514(0)|Q10665(0)|Q9GYS1(0)

Specifically, the complex is required for the formation and growth of astral microtubules and spindle microtubles during mitotic spindle assembly. Thought to function in a partially redundant manner with the Tac-1/Zyg-8 complex to regulate microtubule assembly and processes during interphase, mitosis and meiosis in one-cell stage embryos. The complex directly binds to centosomes throughout the cell cycle and the kinetochore of metaphase and early anaphase chromosomes. At anaphase, the complex is required for mitotic spindle positioning in one-cell stage embryos.	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	G5ECG0(0)|G5EEM5(0)
