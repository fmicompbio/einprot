In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 on two Ser-465 and Ser-467, and SMAD3 on Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighbouring R-Smad subunits.

The DNA recognition sequence depends on the composition of the bZIP dimer with the complex either binding to the preferred region of one of the partners or to a novel bZIP cognate site.	Dimerization is mediated by the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) 60-80 amino acid domain, consisting of a highly conserved DNA binding basic region and a more diversified leucine zipper dimerization region. The latter domain adopts an alpha helical structure where leucine, or leucine-like, side chains line up on the same side of the helix and interact with the alpha helix of the leucine zipper of the other family member to enable dimer formation. DNA binding specificity appears to be linked to low-affinity binding sites which guide transcription factors to their cognate target sites.
