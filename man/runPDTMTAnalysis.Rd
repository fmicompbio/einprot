\arguments{
\item{templateRmd}{Path to the template Rmd. Typically does not need to
be modified.}

\item{outputDir}{Path to a directory where all output files will be
written. Will be created if it doesn't exist.}

\item{outputBaseName}{Character string providing the 'base name' of the
output files. All output files will start with this prefix.}

\item{forceOverwrite}{Logical, whether to force overwrite an existing
Rmd file with the same \code{outputBaseName} in the \code{outputDir}.}

\item{experimentId}{Numeric, the FMI experiment ID.}

\item{pdOutputFolder}{Character string pointing to the PD/TMT output folder.
Should contain the files \code{pdResultName_InputFiles.txt},
\code{pdResultName_StudyInformation.txt} and
\code{pdResultName_Proteins.txt}}

\item{pdResultName}{Character string providing the base name for the
files in the \code{pdOutputFolder}.}

\item{pdAnalysisFile}{Character string pointing to the \code{pdAnalysis}
file}

\item{analysisDetails}{Character string, any specific details about the
analysis to mention in the report.}

\item{cysAlkylation}{Character string.}

\item{sampleIs}{Character string with sample description (e.g., 'digested')}

\item{enzymes}{Character string indicating the enzymes that were used.}

\item{aName}{Character string providing the desired name of the base assay
in the output \code{SingleCellExperiment} object.}

\item{iColPattern}{Regular expression identifying the columns of the PD
\code{Proteins.txt} file to use for the analysis.}

\item{samplePattern}{Regular expression identifying the sample pattern, which
will be removed from the sample ID to generate the group name.}

\item{includeOnlySamples, excludeSamples}{Character vectors defining specific
samples to include or exclude from all analyses.}

\item{minScore}{Numeric, minimum score for a protein to be retained in the
analysis.}

\item{minPeptides}{Numeric, minimum number of peptides for a protein to be
retained in the analysis.}

\item{imputeMethod}{Character string defining the imputation method to use.}

\item{mergeGroups}{Named list of character vectors defining sample groups
to merge to create new groups, that will be used for comparisons.
Any specification of \code{comparisons} or \code{ctrlGroup} should
be done in terms of the new (merged) group names.}

\item{comparisons}{List of character vectors defining comparisons to
perform. The first element of each vector represents the
denominator of the comparison. If not empty, \code{ctrlGroup} and
\code{allPairwiseComparisons} are ignored.}

\item{ctrlGroup}{Character vector defining the sample group(s) to use as
control group in comparisons.}

\item{allPairwiseComparisons}{Logical, should all pairwise comparisons be
performed?}

\item{normMethod}{Character scalar indicating the normalization method to
use.}

\item{stattest}{Either \code{"ttest"} or \code{"limma"}, the testing
framework to use.}

\item{minNbrValidValues}{Numeric, the minimum number of valid values for a
protein to be used for statistical testing.}

\item{minlFC}{Numeric, minimum log fold change to test against (only used
if \code{stattest = "limma"}).}

\item{nperm}{Numeric, number of permutations to use in the statistical
testing (only used if \code{stattest = "ttest"}).}

\item{volcanoAdjPvalThr}{Numeric, adjusted p-value threshold to determine
which proteins to highlight in the volcano plots.}

\item{volcanoLog2FCThr}{Numeric, log-fold change threshold to determine
which proteins to highlight in the volcano plots.}

\item{volcanoMaxFeatures}{Numeric, maximum number of significant features
to label in the volcano plots.}

\item{volcanoS0}{Numeric, S0 value to use to generate the significance
curve in the volcano plots (only used if \code{stattest = "ttest"}).}

\item{volcanoFeaturesToLabel}{Character vector with features to always
label in the volcano plots (regardless of significance).}

\item{complexFDRThr}{Numeric, FDR threshold for significance in testing
of complexes.}

\item{seed}{Numeric, random seed to use for any non-deterministic
calculations.}

\item{includeFeatureCollections}{Character vector, a subset of
c("complexes", "GO").}

\item{customComplexes}{List of character vectors providing custom complexes
to test for significant differences between groups.}

\item{complexSpecies}{Either \code{"all"} or \code{"current"}, depending
on whether complexes defined for all species, or only those defined
for the current species, should be tested for significance.}

\item{complexDbPath}{Character string providing path to the complex DB
file (generated with \code{makeComplexDB()}).}
}

Invisibly, the path to the compiled html report.
