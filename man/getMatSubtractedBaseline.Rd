\title{Extract a matrix and subtract the background/baseline for each feature}
\usage{
getMatSubtractedBaseline(sce, assayName, baselineGroup, sceFull)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object. The colData of the object
must have at least two columns named 'group' and 'batch'.}

\item{assayName}{The name of the assay to extract from \code{sce}.}

\item{baselineGroup}{The value of the 'group' column of
\code{colData(sceFull)} that corresponds to the baseline/reference
samples.}

\item{sceFull}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing at least
the reference samples for each batch in \code{sce}.}
}
\description{
Extract an assay from a SummarizedExperiment, and for each feature subtract
the average value across a set of reference/background/baseline samples.
Typically used to adjust for varying baselines between batches, when a
reference sample is included in each batch.
