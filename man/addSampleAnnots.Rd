\title{Add sample annotations to QFeatures object}
\usage{
addSampleAnnots(qft, iColPattern, sampleAnnot, mergeGroups)
}
\arguments{
\item{qft}{A \code{QFeatures} object.}

\item{iColPattern}{Regular expression to be removed from the column
names of \code{qft} to generate the sample names.}

\item{sampleAnnot}{\code{data.frame} with sample annotations. Must
have at least columns named \code{sample} (which must contain
all the sample names generated by removing the \code{iColPattern}
from the column names of \code{qft}) and \code{group} (which contains
the group assignment for each sample). Can also have a column named
\code{batch}; in this case this will be used as a covariate in the
limma model.}

\item{mergeGroups}{Named list defining groups to merge. Each entry of
the list corresponds to a new group, and consists of a vector
with the group names to merge.}
}
\value{
A \code{QFeatures} object with additional sample annotations.
