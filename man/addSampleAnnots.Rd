\title{Add sample annotations to SummarizedExperiment object}
\usage{
addSampleAnnots(sce, sampleAnnot, mergeGroups = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object.}

\item{sampleAnnot}{\code{data.frame} with sample annotations. Must
have at least columns named \code{sample} (which must contain
all the column names of \code{sce}) and \code{group} (which contains
the group assignment for each sample). Can also have a column named
\code{batch}; in this case this will be used as a covariate in the
limma model.}

\item{mergeGroups}{Named list defining groups to merge. Each entry of
the list corresponds to a new group, and consists of a vector
with the original group names to merge.}
}
\value{
A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object with additional sample
    annotations.
