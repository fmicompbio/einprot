\title{Add sample annotations to SummarizedExperiment object}
\usage{
addSampleAnnots(sce, sampleAnnot)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object (or a derivative).}

\item{sampleAnnot}{A \code{data.frame} with sample annotations. Must
have at least columns named \code{sample} (which must contain
all the column names of \code{sce}) and \code{group} (which contains
the group assignment for each sample).}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as \code{sce} with additional sample
    annotations.
