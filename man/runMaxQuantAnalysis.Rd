\arguments{
\item{templateRmd}{Path to the template Rmd. Typically does not need to
be modified.}

\item{outputDir}{Path to a directory where all output files will be
written. Will be created if it doesn't exist.}

\item{outputBaseName}{Character string providing the 'base name' of the
output files. All output files will start with this prefix.}

\item{reportTitle, reportAuthor}{Character scalars, giving the title and
author for the result report.}

\item{forceOverwrite}{Logical, whether to force overwrite an existing
Rmd file with the same \code{outputBaseName} in the \code{outputDir}.}

\item{experimentInfo}{Named list with information about the experiment.
Each entry of the list must be a scalar value.}

\item{species}{Character scalar providing the species. Must be one of the
supported species (see \code{getSupportedSpecies()}).}

\item{mqFile}{Character string pointing to the MaxQuant
\code{proteinGroups.txt} file.}

\item{mqParameterFile}{Character string pointing to the MaxQuant
parameter (xml) file.}

\item{aName}{Character string providing the desired name of the base assay
in the output \code{SingleCellExperiment} object.}

\item{iColPattern}{Regular expression identifying the columns of the MaxQuant
\code{proteinGroups.txt} file to use for the analysis. Typically either
"^Intensity\\\\.", "^LFQ\\\\.intensity\\\\." or "^iBAQ\\\\."}

\item{sampleAnnot}{A \code{data.frame} with at least columns named
\code{sample} and \code{group}, used to explicitly specify the group
assignment for each sample. It can also contain a column named
\code{batch}, in which case this will be used as a covariate in
the \code{limma} tests.}

\item{includeOnlySamples, excludeSamples}{Character vectors defining specific
samples to include or exclude from all analyses.}

\item{minScore}{Numeric, minimum score for a protein to be retained in the
analysis.}

\item{minPeptides}{Numeric, minimum number of peptides for a protein to be
retained in the analysis.}

\item{imputeMethod}{Character string defining the imputation method to use.}

\item{mergeGroups}{Named list of character vectors defining sample groups
to merge to create new groups, that will be used for comparisons.
Any specification of \code{comparisons} or \code{ctrlGroup} should
be done in terms of the new (merged) group names.}

\item{comparisons}{List of character vectors defining comparisons to
perform. The first element of each vector represents the
denominator of the comparison. If not empty, \code{ctrlGroup} and
\code{allPairwiseComparisons} are ignored.}

\item{ctrlGroup}{Character scalar defining the sample group to use as
control group in comparisons.}

\item{allPairwiseComparisons}{Logical, should all pairwise comparisons be
performed?}

\item{normMethod}{Character scalar indicating the normalization method to
use.}

\item{stattest}{Either \code{"ttest"} or \code{"limma"}, the testing
framework to use.}

\item{minNbrValidValues}{Numeric, the minimum number of valid values for a
protein to be used for statistical testing.}

\item{minlFC}{Numeric, minimum log fold change to test against (only used
if \code{stattest = "limma"}).}

\item{nperm}{Numeric, number of permutations to use in the statistical
testing (only used if \code{stattest = "ttest"}).}

\item{volcanoAdjPvalThr}{Numeric, adjusted p-value threshold to determine
which proteins to highlight in the volcano plots.}

\item{volcanoLog2FCThr}{Numeric, log-fold change threshold to determine
which proteins to highlight in the volcano plots.}

\item{volcanoMaxFeatures}{Numeric, maximum number of significant features
to label in the volcano plots.}

\item{volcanoS0}{Numeric, S0 value to use to generate the significance
curve in the volcano plots (only used if \code{stattest = "ttest"}).}

\item{volcanoFeaturesToLabel}{Character vector with features to always
label in the volcano plots (regardless of significance).}

\item{addInteractiveVolcanos}{Logical scalar indicating whether to add
interactive volcano plots to the html report. For experiments with
many quantified features or many comparisons, setting this to
\code{TRUE} can make the html report very large and difficult to
interact with.}

\item{complexFDRThr}{Numeric, FDR threshold for significance in testing
of complexes.}

\item{seed}{Numeric, random seed to use for any non-deterministic
calculations.}

\item{includeFeatureCollections}{Character vector, a subset of
c("complexes", "GO").}

\item{customComplexes}{List of character vectors providing custom complexes
to test for significant differences between groups.}

\item{complexSpecies}{Either \code{"all"} or \code{"current"}, depending
on whether complexes defined for all species, or only those defined
for the current species, should be tested for significance.}

\item{complexDbPath}{Character string providing path to the complex DB
file (generated with \code{makeComplexDB()}).}

\item{customYml}{Character string providing the path to a custom YAML file
that can be used to overwrite default settings in the report. If set
to \code{NULL} (default), no alterations are made.}

\item{doRender}{Logical scalar. If \code{FALSE}, the Rmd file will be
generated (and any parameters injected), but not rendered.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the compiled html report.
