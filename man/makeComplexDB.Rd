\usage{
makeComplexDB(
  dbDir,
  customComplexTxt = NULL,
  Cyc2008Db = NULL,
  CorumDb = NULL,
  PombaseDb = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbDir}{Path to database directory, where all raw files will be
downloaded and the output will be saved. Will be created if it
doesn't exist.}

\item{customComplexTxt}{File path to text file with custom complexes
(if any). Should be a tab-delimited text file with five columns:
"Complex.name", "Gene.names", "Organism", "Source", "PMID".}

\item{Cyc2008Db, CorumDb, PombaseDb}{data.frames providing annotations from
CYC2008 (S cerevisiae), Corum (mammals) and Pombase (S pombe),
respectively. These arguments are provided mainly to allow testing, and
typically are not specified by the end user. If \code{NULL}
(the default), the files will be downloaded from the paths indicated in
the Details.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the generated complex database.
}
\description{
This function generates a comprehensive cross-species database of
protein complexes. It downloads the complex definitions from
http://wodaklab.org/cyc2008/resources/CYC2008_complex.tab (S. cerevisiae),
https://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/download/releases/current/allComplexes.txt.zip
(mammals) and
https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/GO_complexes/Complex_annotation.tsv
(S. pombe), and next uses the \code{babelgene} package to map the
complexes to orthologs in the other species.
