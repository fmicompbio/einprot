\title{Generate a comprehensive database of complexes}
\usage{
makeComplexDB(
  dbDir,
  customComplexTxt = NULL,
  Cyc2008Db = NULL,
  CorumDb = NULL,
  PombaseDb = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbDir}{Path to database directory, where all raw files will be
downloaded and the output will be saved. Will be created if it
doesn't exist.}

\item{customComplexTxt}{File path to text file with custom complexes
(if any). Should be a tab-delimited text file with five columns:
\code{"Complex.name"}, \code{"Gene.names"}, \code{"Organism"},
\code{"Source"}, \code{"PMID"}.}

\item{Cyc2008Db, CorumDb, PombaseDb}{data.frames providing annotations from
CYC2008 (S cerevisiae), Corum (mammals) and Pombase (S pombe),
respectively. These arguments are provided mainly to allow testing, and
typically are not specified by the end user, except in cases where the
files have already been downloaded and stored locally. If provided,
it is important that the data frames are obtained by simply reading the
downloaded text files - the function assumes a certain set of columns.
If \code{NULL} (the default), the files will be downloaded from the
paths indicated in the Details.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the generated complex database.
}
\description{
This function generates a comprehensive cross-species database of
protein complexes. It downloads the complex definitions from
\url{http://wodaklab.org/cyc2008/resources/CYC2008_complex.tab} (S. cerevisiae),
\url{https://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/download/releases/current/allComplexes.txt.zip}
(mammals) and
\url{https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Gene_ontology/GO_complexes/Complex_annotation.tsv}
(S. pombe), and next uses the \code{babelgene} package to map the
complexes to orthologs in the other species. A pre-generated version of the
database is provided with \code{einprot} (see \code{listComplexDBs()}).
}
\examples{
## Read small subsets of the raw files provided with einprot to make the
## processing faster. Typically, the files would be downloaded as part of
## the process of generating the complex DB.
