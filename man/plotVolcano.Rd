\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object (or a derivative).}

\item{res}{A \code{data.frame} object with test results (typically
generated by \code{runTest}).}

\item{testType}{Character scalar indicating the type of test that was run,
either \code{"ttest"} or \code{"limma"}.}

\item{xv, yv}{Character scalars indicating which columns of \code{res} that
should be used as the x- and y-axis of the volcano plot, respectively.}

\item{xvma}{If not \code{NULL}, a character scalar indicating which
column of \code{res} should be used as the x-axis for an MA plot. The
y-axis column will be \code{xv}. If \code{NULL}, no MA plot is
generated.}

\item{volcind}{Character scalar indicating which column in \code{res} that
represents the "significance" column. This should be a logical
column; rows with a value equal to \code{TRUE} will be colored
in the plot.}

\item{plotnote}{Character scalar with a note to add to the plot.}

\item{plottitle}{Character scalar giving the title of the plot.}

\item{plotsubtitle}{Character scalar giving the subtitle of the plot.}

\item{volcanoFeaturesToLabel}{Character vector, features to label in the
plot.}

\item{volcanoMaxFeatures}{Numeric scalar, the maximum number of features
to color in the plot.}

\item{baseFileName}{Character scalar or \code{NULL}, the base file name of
the output files. If \code{NULL}, no result files are generated.}

\item{comparisonString}{Character scalar giving the name of the comparison of
interest. This is used to extract the appropriate column from the
metadata of the feature collections to make the gene set plots.}

\item{stringDb}{A STRINGdb object or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL},
STRING network plots of up- and downregulated genes will be added to
the output pdf file.}

\item{featureCollections}{A list of \code{CharacterList}s with feature
collections. If there is a collection named \code{"complexes"},
volcano plots and barplots for significant complexes are included in
the output pdf files.}

\item{complexFDRThr}{Numeric scalar giving the FDR threshold for complexes
to be considered significant.}

\item{maxNbrComplexesToPlot}{Numeric scalar, the largest number of
significant complexes to generate separate volcano plots for.}

\item{curveparam}{List with curve parameters for creating the Perseus-like
significance curves in the volcano plots.}

\item{abundanceColPat}{Character scalar providing the column pattern used
to identify abundance columns in the result table, to make bar plots
for significant complexes. Typically the name of an assay.}
}
\value{
A list with two plot objects; one ggplot object and one
    interactive ggiraph object. If \code{xvma} is not \code{NULL},
    the list will also contain a ggplot object for the MA plot.
    If \code{baseFileName} is not \code{NULL}, pdf files with volcano
    plots and bar plots for significant complexes will also be generated.
