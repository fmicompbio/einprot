\arguments{
\item{qft}{A \code{QFeatures} object.}

\item{res}{A \code{data.frame} object with test results (typically
generated by \code{runTest}).}

\item{testType}{Character scalar indicating the type of test that was run,
either \code{"ttest"} or \code{"limma"}.}

\item{xv, yv}{Character scalars indicating which columns of \code{res} that
should be used as the x- and y-axis, respectively.}

\item{volcind}{Character scalar indicating which column in \code{res} that
represents the "significance" column. This should be a logical
column; rows with a value equal to \code{TRUE} will be colored
in the plot.}

\item{plotnote}{Character scalar with a note to add to the plot.}

\item{plottitle}{Character scalar giving the title of the plot.}

\item{plotsubtitle}{Character scalar giving the subtitle of the plot.}

\item{volcanoFeaturesToLabel}{Character vector, features to label in the
plot.}

\item{volcanoMaxFeatures}{Numeric scalar, the maximum number of features
to color in the plot.}

\item{baseFileName}{Character scalar or \code{NULL}, the base file name of
the output files. If \code{NULL}, no result files are generated.}

\item{comparisonString}{Character scalar giving the name of the comparison of
interest. This is used to extract the appropriate column from the
metadata of the feature collections to make the gene set plots.}

\item{stringDb}{A STRINGdb object or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL},
STRING network plots of up- and downregulated genes will be added to
the output pdf file.}

\item{featureCollections}{A list of \code{CharacterList}s with feature
collections. If there is a collection named \code{"complexes"},
volcano plots and barplots for significant complexes are included in
the output pdf files.}

\item{complexFDRThr}{Numeric scalar giving the FDR threshold for complexes
to be considered significant.}

\item{curveparam}{List with curve parameters for creating the Perseus-like
significance curves in the volcano plots.}
}
\value{
A list with two plot objects; one ggplot object and one
    interactive ggiraph object. If \code{baseFileName} is not \code{NULL},
    pdf files with volcano plots and bar plots for significant
    complexes will also be generated.
