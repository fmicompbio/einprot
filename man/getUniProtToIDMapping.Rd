\title{Get mapping from UniProt IDs to another ID type}
\usage{
getUniProtToIDMapping(species, targetId = "Gene_Name")
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{Either a taxonomy ID, a species ID or a common species name.
See \code{getSupportedSpecies()} for valid values.}

\item{targetId}{Character scalar giving the target ID type. Should be one
of the ID types included in the second column in the UniProt ID mapping
files. Examples include "Gene_Name", "Ensembl", "STRING", "RefSeq_NT"}
}
\value{
A data.frame with two columns, corresponding to the UniProtID and
    the corresponding other ID. Note that both columns can have
    duplicated values, if there is not a one-to-one mapping between
    UniProtIDs and the other ID type.
}
\description{
Generate a data.frame with the mapping between UniProtIDs and another ID type.
The mapping is obtained from the UniProt ID mapping files (downloaded from
https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/).
