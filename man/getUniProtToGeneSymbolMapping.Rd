\title{Get mapping from UniProt IDs to gene symbol}
\usage{
getUniProtToGeneSymbolMapping(species)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{Either a taxonomy ID, a species ID or a common species name.
See \code{getSupportedSpecies()} for valid values.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with two columns, corresponding to the UniProtID and
    the corresponding gene symbol. Note that both columns can have
    duplicated values, if there is not a one-to-one mapping between
    UniProtIDs and gene symbols.
}
\description{
Generate a data.frame with the mapping between UniProtIDs and gene symbols.
The mapping is obtained from the UniProt ID mapping files (downloaded from
https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/).
