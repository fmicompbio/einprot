\title{Compile a list of comparisons}
\usage{
makeListOfComparisons(
  allGroups,
  comparisons,
  mergeGroups = list(),
  allPairwiseComparisons,
  ctrlGroup,
  discardGroup = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{allGroups}{Character vector containing all group labels in the
dataset.}

\item{comparisons}{List of length-2 character vectors defining comparisons
to perform. The first element of each vector represents the
denominator of the comparison, the second the numerator.
If \code{comparisons} is non-empty, \code{ctrlGroup} and
\code{allPairwiseComparisons} are ignored. If one of the two elements
in the vector is "complement", it will be created as the complement
of the other group.}

\item{mergeGroups}{Named list defining groups to merge. Each entry of the
list corresponds to a new group, and consists of a vector with the
original group names (a subset of \code{allGroups}). Only comparisons
contrasting non-overlapping sets of groups will be performed.}

\item{allPairwiseComparisons}{Logical scalar, whether all pairwise
comparisons shall be performed.}

\item{ctrlGroup}{Character scalar defining the sample group to use as
control group in comparisons.}

\item{discardGroup}{Character vector. Any comparison including any of
these groups will be discarded.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
 \item{\code{comparisons}}{ - a list of vectors of length 2, indicating
 the pairwise group comparisons.}
 \item{\code{groupComposition}}{ - a list specifying the composition of
 each group label used in \code{comparisons}, in terms of the original
 group names. This is used to keep track of the composition of merged
 groups.}
}
}
\description{
Construct a list defining the pairwise group comparisons that will be
performed.
}
\examples{
## Perform all pairwise comparisons
makeListOfComparisons(allGroups = c("g1", "g2", "g3"),
                      comparisons = list(), mergeGroups = list(),
                      allPairwiseComparisons = TRUE,
                      ctrlGroup = "g1")

## Pre-specify the comparisons
makeListOfComparisons(allGroups = c("g1", "g2", "g3"),
                      comparisons = list(c("g1", "g3")),
                      mergeGroups = list(),
                      allPairwiseComparisons = TRUE,
                      ctrlGroup = "g1")

## Compare each group to its complement
makeListOfComparisons(allGroups = c("g1", "g2", "g3"),
                      comparisons = lapply(c("g1", "g2", "g3"),
                                           function(g) c("complement", g)),
                      mergeGroups = list(),
                      allPairwiseComparisons = TRUE,
                      ctrlGroup = "")
