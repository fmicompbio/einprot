\usage{
prepareFeatureCollections(
  sce,
  idCol,
  includeFeatureCollections,
  complexDbPath,
  speciesInfo,
  complexSpecies,
  customComplexes = list(),
  minSizeToKeep = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object (or a derivative).}

\item{idCol}{Character scalar, indicating which column in
\code{rowData(sce)} that contains IDs matching those in the
feature collections (gene symbols).}

\item{includeFeatureCollections}{Character vector indicating the types
of feature collections to prepare. Should be a subset of
\code{c("complexes", "GO")} or \code{NULL}.}

\item{complexDbPath}{Character scalar providing the path to the database
of complexes, generated using \code{makeComplexDB()} and serialized
to a .rds file.}

\item{speciesInfo}{List with at least two entries (\code{species} and
\code{speciesCommon}), providing the species information. Typically
generated using \code{getSpeciesInfo()}.}

\item{complexSpecies}{Character scalar, either \code{"all"} or
\code{"current"}, indicating whether all complexes should be
tested, or only those defined for the current species.}

\item{customComplexes}{Named list, for providing any custom complexes
that are not already included in the database provided via
\code{complexDbPath}.}

\item{minSizeToKeep}{Numeric scalar, indicating the minimum size of a
feature collection to be retained.}
}
\value{
A list of \code{CharacterList}s (one for each feature collection).
}
\description{
Prepare feature collections for testing with camera. The function maps
the feature IDs in the collections (complexes or GO terms) to the
values in the specified \code{idCol} column of \code{rowData(sce)},
and subsequently replaces them with the corresponding row names of the
\code{SummarizedExperiment} object. Feature sets with too few features
(after the matching) are removed.
