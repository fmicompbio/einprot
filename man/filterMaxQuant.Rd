\item{minScore}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the 'Score'
column in order to retain the feature.}

\item{minPeptides}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the
'Peptides' column in order to retain the feature.}

\item{plotUpset}{Logical scalar, whether to generate an UpSet plot
detailing the reasons for features being filtered out. Only
generated if any feature is in fact filtered out.}
