\title{Filter out features in Spectronaut data}
\usage{
filterSpectronaut(
  sce,
  minScore,
  minPeptides,
  plotUpset = TRUE,
  revPattern = "_Decoy$",
  exclFile = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object (or a derivative).}

\item{minScore}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the 'PG.Cscore'
column in order to retain the feature.}

\item{minPeptides}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the
'PG.NrOfStrippedSequencesIdentified.Experiment.wide' column in order to
retain the feature.}

\item{plotUpset}{Logical scalar, whether to generate an UpSet plot
detailing the reasons for features being filtered out. Only
generated if any feature is in fact filtered out.}

\item{revPattern}{Character scalar providing the pattern (a regular
expression) used to identify decoys (reverse hits). The pattern is
matched against the IDs in the Spectronaut \code{PG.ProteinGroups}
column.}

\item{exclFile}{Character scalar, the path to a text file where the
features that are filtered out are written. If \code{NULL} (default),
excluded features are not recorded.}
}
\value{
A filtered object of the same type as \code{sce}.
}
\description{
Exclude features with 'PG.Cscore' below \code{minScore},
'PG.NrOfStrippedSequencesIdentified.Experiment.wide' below
\code{minPeptides}, or where the 'PG.ProteinGroups' column contains the
specified \code{revPattern}.
