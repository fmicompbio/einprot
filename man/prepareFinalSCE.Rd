}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SingleCellExperiment} object.}

\item{baseFileName}{Character scalar or \code{NULL}, the base file name of
the output files. If \code{NULL}, no result files are generated.}

\item{featureCollections}{List of \code{CharacterList}s with results
from gene set testing.}

\item{expType}{Character scalar, either "MaxQuant", "ProteomeDiscoverer"
or "FragPipe".}
