\usage{
getComplexesToPlot(
  featureCollections,
  complexCandidates,
  maxNbrComplexesToPlot,
  maxComplexSimilarity
)
}
\arguments{
\item{featureCollections}{A \code{CharacterList} with feature set
definitions.}

\item{complexCandidates}{A character vector with feature set names that are
candidates for plotting. More significant candidates should appear
earlier in the vector.}

\item{maxNbrComplexesToPlot}{A numeric scalar indicating the maximum
number of complexes that can be selected.}

\item{maxComplexSimilarity}{A numeric scalar. If a complex C is more
similar than \code{maxComplexSimilarity} to a complex earlier in the
vector, which has been selected for plotting, C will not be selected.}
}
\value{
A character vector with feature sets from \code{complexCandidates}
selected for plotting.
