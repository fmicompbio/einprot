\title{Filter out features in PD/TMT data}
\usage{
filterPDTMT(
  sce,
  inputLevel,
  minScore = 0,
  minPeptides = 0,
  minDeltaScore = 0,
  minPSMs = 0,
  masterProteinsOnly = FALSE,
  plotUpset = TRUE,
  exclFile = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object (or a derivative).}

\item{inputLevel}{Either "Proteins" or "PeptideGroups", indicating the type
of features in \code{sce}.}

\item{minScore}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the
'Score.Sequest.HT.Sequest.HT' column in order to retain the feature.
Only used if \code{inputLevel} is "Proteins".}

\item{minPeptides}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the
'Number.of.Peptides' column in order to retain the feature.
Only used if \code{inputLevel} is "Proteins".}

\item{minDeltaScore}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the
'Delta.Score.by.Search.Engine.Sequest.HT' column in order to retain the
feature. Only used if \code{inputLevel} is "PeptideGroups".}

\item{minPSMs}{Numeric scalar, the minimum allowed value in the
'Number.of.PSMs' column in order to retain the feature.
Only used if \code{inputLevel} is "PeptideGroups".}

\item{masterProteinsOnly}{Logical scalar indicating whether only master
proteins (where the \code{Master} column value is
\code{IsMasterProtein}) should be retained.}

\item{plotUpset}{Logical scalar, whether to generate an UpSet plot
detailing the reasons for features being filtered out. Only
generated if any feature is in fact filtered out.}

\item{exclFile}{Character scalar, the path to a text file where the
features that are filtered out are written. If \code{NULL} (default),
excluded features are not recorded.}
}
\value{
A filtered object of the same type as \code{sce}.
}
\description{
If \code{inputLevel} is "Proteins", exclude features with
'Score.Sequest.HT.Sequest.HT' below \code{minScore},
'Number.of.Peptides' below \code{minPeptides}, or identified as
'Contaminant' by ProteomeDiscoverer.
If \code{inputLevel} is "PeptideGroups", exclude features with
'Delta.Score.by.Search.Engine.Sequest.HT' below \code{minDeltaScore},
'Number.of.PSMs' below \code{minPSMs}, or identified as
'Contaminant' by ProteomeDiscoverer.
