\title{Import data from Spectronaut into a SingleCellExperiment object}
\usage{
importSpectronaut(
  inFile,
  outLevel = "pg",
  includeOnlySamples = "",
  excludeSamples = "",
  stopIfEmpty = FALSE,
  aName = "PG.Quantity",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inFile}{Path to a tab-delimited input text file from Spectronaut.}

\item{outLevel}{Character scalar indicating the desired output level;
currently only \code{"pg"} (protein group) is supported.}

\item{includeOnlySamples, excludeSamples}{Character vectors defining
regular expressions to match against the extracted columns to
retain or exclude samples.}

\item{stopIfEmpty}{Logical scalar, whether to raise an error if no
columns matching the patterns are found.}

\item{aName}{Character scalar giving the
column from which to get the values for the main assay.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that will be passed on to
\code{QFeatures::readSummarizedExperiment} (e.g., the number of rows
to import).}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: a \code{SingleCellExperiment} object and
a character scalar with the main assay name.
}
\description{
Import data from a Spectronaut quantification file into a
\code{SingleCellExperiment} object. Note that Spectronaut support in einprot
is currently experimental - please be aware that the interface may change,
and interpret results with caution.
